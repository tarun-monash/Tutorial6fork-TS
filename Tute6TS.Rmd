## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)

```

## Generating data from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1
```{r}
# Simulating data according to a normal distribution
x <- seq(1:100)
y <- rnorm(100) # Generating data form a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1
data <- data.frame(x = x, y = y )
p1 = ggplot(data, aes(x= x, y = y)) +
   geom_line()
p2 = ggplot(data, aes(x= x, y = y)) +
   geom_point()
grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
